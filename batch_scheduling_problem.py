    Batch Scheduling Problem

    In this problem, a set of tasks must be processed in batches on available resources.
    Each task is characterized by:
      - A fixed resource assignment.
      - A task type.
      - A processing duration.
      - Precedence (successor) constraints.
      
    A candidate solution is represented as a dictionary with one key:
      - "batch_schedule": a list of batches.
    
    Each batch is a dictionary with:
      - "resource": an integer (the resource on which the batch is processed),
      - "tasks": a list of task indices assigned to that batch,
      - "start": the start time (integer) of the batch,
      - "end": the end time (integer) of the batch.

    For a batch to be feasible, all tasks in the batch must have the same type and duration,
    and the number of tasks cannot exceed the capacity of the resource.
    
    Moreover, batches scheduled on the same resource must not overlap, and precedence constraints 
    between tasks must be satisfied.
    
    The objective is to minimize the makespan â€“ the maximum finishing time among all batches.

        Construct a complete QUBO formulation of the scheduling problem.
        
        This method defines binary variables x_{t,s} for each task t and each allowed start time s.
        The QUBO includes the following penalty terms:
          1. Unique assignment: each task must have exactly one start time.
          2. Precedence: for every precedence constraint i->j, if task i starts at s and task j at s'
             with s + duration[i] > s', a penalty is added.
          3. Non-overlap: for tasks on the same resource (but not in the same batch) the later task's
             start time must be at least the earlier task's finish time.
          4. Capacity: for each resource r and each time slot s, if more than capacity[r] tasks are scheduled,
             a penalty is added (approximated by penalizing every pair of tasks assigned at the same time).
          5. Batch consistency: if tasks on the same resource are scheduled at the same time but have different
             type or duration, a penalty is added.
