    Batch Scheduling Problem

    In this problem, a set of tasks must be processed in batches on available resources.
    Each task is characterized by:
      - A fixed resource assignment.
      - A task type.
      - A processing duration.
      - Precedence (successor) constraints.
      
    A candidate solution is represented as a dictionary with one key:
      - "batch_schedule": a list of batches.
    
    Each batch is a dictionary with:
      - "resource": an integer (the resource on which the batch is processed),
      - "tasks": a list of task indices assigned to that batch,
      - "start": the start time (integer) of the batch,
      - "end": the end time (integer) of the batch.

    For a batch to be feasible, all tasks in the batch must have the same type and duration,
    and the number of tasks cannot exceed the capacity of the resource.
    
    Moreover, batches scheduled on the same resource must not overlap, and precedence constraints 
    between tasks must be satisfied.
    
    The objective is to minimize the makespan â€“ the maximum finishing time among all batches.
